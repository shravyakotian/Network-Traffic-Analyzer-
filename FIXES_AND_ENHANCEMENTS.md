# Network Traffic Analyzer - Fixed and Enhanced

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Administrative Privileges Detection**
- **Problem**: `os.getuid()` doesn't exist on Windows
- **Fix**: Added Windows-specific admin detection using `ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin()`

### 2. **Interface Selection**
- **Problem**: Selected network interface wasn't being passed to the packet capture function
- **Fix**: Modified the monitoring start button to pass the selected interface parameter

### 3. **Packet Statistics Duplicate Updates**
- **Problem**: Capture statistics were being updated twice (in process_packet and handle_packet)
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate stats update in process_packet function

### 4. **Field Selection Management**
- **Problem**: Checkbox selections weren't properly managed across page refreshes
- **Fix**: Implemented proper session state management for field selections

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Added**: Better error messages and capture statistics
- **Added**: Stop monitoring functionality that properly stops the sniffing thread
- **Added**: Clear captured data functionality

## üåê Enhanced Diagnostic Script

The diagnostic script now shows **websites visited** during the test period:

### Features Added:
- **DNS Query Detection**: Captures domain name lookups
- **HTTP Host Header Extraction**: Identifies websites from HTTP traffic
- **HTTPS SNI Detection**: Extracts domain names from HTTPS connections
- **Real-time Website List**: Shows all detected domains during the 15-second test

### Example Output:
```
üåê Websites/Domains Detected (6):
  ‚Ä¢ applet-bundles.grammarly.net
  ‚Ä¢ gnar.grammarly.com
  ‚Ä¢ mobile.events.data.microsoft.com
  ‚Ä¢ github.com
  ‚Ä¢ www.google.com
  ‚Ä¢ stackoverflow.com
```

## üöÄ How to Use the Fixed Application

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic (Recommended)
```bash
python diagnostic.py
```
This will:
- Check system requirements
- Test packet capture capability
- Show websites visited during the test
- Provide specific recommendations

### Step 2: Start the Application
```bash
streamlit run app_ui.py
```

### Step 3: Configure Settings
1. **Check System Diagnostics** section for any warnings
2. **Select Network Interface** in the sidebar (try different ones if default doesn't work)
3. **Choose Fields to Display** - select at least these basic fields:
   - S.No
   - Timestamp
   - Source IP
   - Destination IP
   - Protocol
   - Packet Size

### Step 4: Start Monitoring
1. Click "üöÄ Start Continuous Monitoring"
2. Generate network traffic (browse websites, download files, etc.)
3. Watch the **capture statistics** at the top:
   - Total Packets Captured
   - Packets in Memory
   - Last Packet timestamp

### Step 5: Verify It's Working
- The "Total Packets Captured" counter should increase
- "Last Packet" should show recent timestamps
- Packet data should appear in the table below

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### If No Packets Are Captured:

1. **Run as Administrator** (Most Important)
   ```bash
   # Right-click Command Prompt ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"
   cd "C:\Users\raksh\Music\Projects\Network-Traffic-Analyzer-"
   streamlit run app_ui.py
   ```

2. **Try Different Network Interfaces**
   - Use the interface selector in the sidebar
   - Try Interface 1, 2, 3, etc. until you find one that works

3. **Generate Network Traffic**
   - Browse websites
   - Download files
   - Stream videos
   - Use any network-connected applications

4. **Check Windows Security**
   - Temporarily disable Windows Defender real-time protection
   - Add Python to firewall exceptions
   - Install Npcap if not already installed

5. **Verify with Diagnostic**
   - Run `python diagnostic.py` to confirm packet capture works
   - If diagnostic shows websites, the application should work too

### Error Messages Explained:

- **"No packets captured yet"**: Normal when starting - generate network traffic
- **"Permission denied"**: Run as Administrator
- **"Interface not found"**: Try a different interface from the dropdown
- **"No fields selected"**: Select fields to display in the sidebar

## üéØ Expected Results

When working correctly, you should see:
- **Real-time packet count** increasing
- **Network traffic data** in the table
- **Protocol analysis** showing HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.
- **Source/Destination IPs** of your network traffic
- **DNS queries** showing websites you visit

## üìä Application Features

### Enhanced UI:
- System diagnostics with admin status
- Network interface selection
- Real-time capture statistics
- Better error reporting
- Clear data functionality

### Packet Analysis:
- Protocol distribution
- Top source/destination IPs
- Data volume by source
- Potential DDoS detection
- Website/domain tracking

### Export Options:
- CSV download of filtered packets
- Analysis report generation
- Custom field selection

## ‚úÖ Verification

The application has been tested and verified:
- All imports work correctly
- Basic functionality tests pass
- Packet capture works (verified with diagnostic)
- Website detection works (shows domains visited)
- Interface selection implemented
- Error handling improved

You should now be able to capture and analyze your network traffic successfully!
